# Car-Price-Prediction
*This dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com*
### Project Overview
1. *Created a model that predicts old vehicle price basis Kms driven, number of years used, number of owners, etc.*
1. *Engineered features ....*
3. *Optimized Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoost regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.*


### Resources Used
1. *Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn*..
1. *Dataset by Nehal Birla: https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho*

### Data Cleaning
1. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*

### Feature Engineering
1. *Transformed the categorical variables into dummy variables*
2. *Split the data into train and tests sets with a test size of 30%*

### Model Building
#### Algorithms used for this project are as follows:
1. *Multiple Linear Regression*
2. *Decision Tree*
3. *Random Forest*
4. *Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost)*

### Model Evaluation
Used Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric

### Future Scope
1. * Vehicle price predication model should also done bassis Model Name. Due to data limitations it was not in scope in this application*
2. *Implement this problem statement using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)...*
