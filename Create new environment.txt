Always create new environment whenever you will work on any project.

Open Anconda Prompt
Do google search - create anaconda environment 

copy and paste commnad on A. prompt

1. conda create -n writeownenvirnment_name python=3.7   -- enter

2. press y - installation of pkgs will automatically happen	
3. activate writeownenvirnment_name 
4. cls
5. cd <paste particular path location>
6. dir -- it will show all directories and file names
7. jupyter notebook  -- it will create new jupyter notebook


To view all environments in promt
conda info --envs
